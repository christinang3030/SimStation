SimStation is a framework that follows agent-based architecture for creating simulations, 
It is built on top of another framework based on model-view-controller architecture.

A simulation involves a population of agents moving around an environment and interacting 
with random neighbors. The following buttons are provided to run through the simulation: 
start, suspend, resume, and stop.

1. Random Walks: Simulates people moving at changing directions and speeds.
2. Flocking: Simulates birds grouping together to form flocks.
3. Plague: Simulates a viral illness spreading between people.
4. Prisoner's Dilemma Tournament: Simulates prisoners playing the prisoner's dilemma with 
      varying strategies.
